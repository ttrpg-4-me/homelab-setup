# Homelab Setup

This repo will hold everything related to my homelab, from documentation to configuration.

## Mission Statement

I hope to accomplish the following with my homelab:

- Securely host TTRPG resources such as a VTT software.
- Provide an efficient user experience for about a dozen users located around the world.
- Learn advanced nertworking concepts through hands-on experience.
- Get more practice writing Go.
- Minimize costs by building homelab components out of E-waste where possible.
- Experiment with project management tools.

## Glossary
